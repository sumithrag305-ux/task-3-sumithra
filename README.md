# Task 3 – SQL for Data Analysis

This project contains the full SQL practice for **Task 3** of the Data Analyst Internship.

## 📌 Database Used
- **Database Name:** `task3_db`
- **Tables:**
  - `students`
  - `courses`

## 📂 Files Included
- **task3.sql** – complete SQL file with all queries
- **screenshots/** – output screenshots from MySQL Workbench
- **README.md** – task explanation and documentation

## 🔍 Concepts Covered
✔ SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
✔ GROUP BY, HAVING
✔ INNER JOIN / LEFT JOIN / RIGHT JOIN
✔ SUBQUERIES
✔ SUM, AVG, COUNT (Aggregate Functions)
✔ VIEWS
✔ INDEXES (Query Optimization)

## 📝 Steps Performed
1. Created the `students` and `courses` tables
2. Inserted sample data
3. Performed data analysis using SELECT & WHERE
4. Used ORDER BY, GROUP BY & HAVING
5. Applied JOINS to combine tables
6. Wrote simple subqueries
7. Created a SQL VIEW (`student_report`)
8. Checked indexes for optimization
9. Captured screenshots of outputs

## 🖼 Screenshot Checklist
Include the following in the `/screenshots` folder:
- students table (`students.png`)
- courses table (`courses.png`)
- inner join output (`inner_join.png`)
- group by output (`groupby.png`)
- subquery output (`subquery.png`)
- view output (`view.png`)
- index output (`index.png`)

## ✔ Outcome
Successfully completed SQL data analysis using MySQL and created a clean, organized GitHub repository for submission.
